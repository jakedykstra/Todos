## Complete RESTful Todos API 
Simple app that allows you to enter in your daily todos and strike through them when completed. Use Mongodb backend for storing info. 

## Motivation
I built this to further my skillbase with React and Redux. Moving forward I want to transition to now applying GraphQL and ApolloClient.
 
## Features
* Minimalistic view for straightforward narrative to day.
* Building out timer functionality and editor.

## Installation
After fork, install the dependencies then npm run start to run both front and backend servers. You will also have to activate Mongodb on your server. 
```
mongod
npm i -g
npm run start
```

## How to use?
Simple. Type in brief descriptor of your day and enter it in. When finished click on the todo in list to strike through.
